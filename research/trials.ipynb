The process of identifying pain \\nis known as nociception. Specialised receptors called nocireceptors are \\nnerve endings found throughout skin, muscles and internal organs.\\nThe pain experienced while touching a hot vessel is called nociceptive \\npain. Here, a sensory neuron or nociceptor, transmits impulses to the \\nspinal nerve and then to the brain. Then pain is experienced.\\nDue to an infection or tissue damage, the body produces molecules \\nsuch as cytokines and chemokines. These also lead to pain. Pain can \\nalso be experienced in conditions such as neuropathy, where peripheral \\nnerve damage occurs.'),\n",

Hearing aids are also available.\\nAn excerpt from a science article related to \\nhearing is given below. Analyse it, discuss the \\nways to prevent hearing impairments and \\norganise awareness programmes.\\nHearing is a divine gift that nature has bestowed on humans. Sound \\nthat travels in the form of waves can be transmitted only through a \\nmedium. A sound that can be heard in a condition of complete silence \\nis represented as zero decibel. For every 10 decibels, the intensity of \\nthe sound increases tenfold. In a normal conversation, intensity of the \\nsound will be between 40 and 50 decibels. It can be up to 60 decibels, \\nwhile speaking loudly. The normal sound of the honking of a car horn \\nis 70 decibels, while that of an air horn is 100-110 decibels. Intensity of \\nnoise above 80 decibels is extremely annoying. Noise pollution is a \\ndanger that is most harmful and unfortunately, the most neglected of \\nall the environment pollutions that we face today. Hearing of loud \\nnoise (above 85 decibel) for a short time and less noise with a lesser \\nintensity (below 55 decibel) for a very very long time can cause \\npermanent hearing impairment.\\n'),\n",

The process of identifying pain \\nis known as nociception. Specialised receptors called nocireceptors are \\nnerve endings found throughout skin, muscles and internal organs.\\nThe pain experienced while touching a hot vessel is called nociceptive \\npain. Here, a sensory neuron or nociceptor, transmits impulses to the \\nspinal nerve and then to the brain. Then pain is experienced.\\nDue to an infection or tissue damage, the body produces molecules \\nsuch as cytokines and chemokines. These also lead to pain.
